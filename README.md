Worksheet 16: Do codeschool TryR chapter 6

Why do you think is it more practical to have data in a data.frame then in individual vectors?

To avoid trouble,it is better if we can tie all these variables together in a single data structure. And you can do that by using data.frame

nameofdata.frame [[number of column]] 
nameofdata.frame [[column name]] 
use a shorthand notation. for example if you are tryign to get the prices column you can use nameofdata.frame$prices the $ is a shorthand notation so you don't have to use the brackets


You've learned three ways to extract a column from a data.frame. Which are they?

Use read.csv for files that are separate with commas.
For files that use separator strings other than commas, you can use the read.table function.

The read.table() and read.csv() functions are extremely useful. Which are the different arguments for these functions used in the tutorial?

Great. Almost done with all the codeschool stuff!
